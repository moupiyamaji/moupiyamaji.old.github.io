Astrophysicist with extensive research experience in galaxies, star clusters, radiation transfer, computational astrophysics, and statistical data analysis. 

I have an academic background in both physics and astrophysics and have taught several theoretical and practical undergraduate courses, along with supervising master's student projects. I am interested in roles that combinesboth teaching and research. I am also passionate about in public outreach and effective science communication.
